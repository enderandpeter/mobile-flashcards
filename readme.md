# Mobile Flashcards
## Final Udacity React Nanodegree project

### Platform
This app is only for iOS. It has only been tested as an Expo app in the iOS simulator and
on an iPhone 7.

### Instructions

#### Setup

Simply run `yarn install` and `yarn start` in the root folder. Or use `npm` if you wish. I trust you are familiar with Expo apps.

#### Usage

Add a deck by pressing *Add Deck*. Enter a name and click *Submit*. A deck of an existing name will
overwrite that deck and remove all cards.

When viewing a deck, click *Add Card* to add some cards, specifying the Question and Answer.

If a deck has at least one card, you can press *Start Quiz*. As you go through the quiz, the app will save your progress.

Press *Answer* to view the answer and *Question* to view the question. Press *Correct* or *Incorrect* to progress
to the next question. After the last question/card, you will be shown a score of the number you got correct.

At the score screen, press *Restart Quiz* to restart, or click the upper left nav button to go back to
the deck.
